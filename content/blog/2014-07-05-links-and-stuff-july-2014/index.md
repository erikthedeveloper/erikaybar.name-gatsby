If there is anything that is universal to web developers across technological and cultural boundaries, it is searching for solutions ... a lot. 

I've decided that I will keep a log of the most useful links I come across. Maybe they will help others out on their similar quests ... and! ... More likely so I can have a quick way to reference "that article that seems to have been lost in the abyss that is my browser history".

I will keep these types of lists down to only resources that I, for some reason or other, found noteworthy at the time. Feel free to share any must-have's that you feel belong on the list.

Pardon the lack of details ;)
