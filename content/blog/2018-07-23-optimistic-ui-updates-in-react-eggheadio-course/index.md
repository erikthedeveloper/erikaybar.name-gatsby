It's been out for several months now, but my first [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) course was recently released 🎉 The course is [Optimistic UI Updates in React](https://egghead.io/courses/optimistic-ui-updates-in-react) where I illustrate by example creating more responsive, snappier user interfaces by leveraging optimistic UI updates specifically with React although the concept applies generally regardless of technologies and frameworks involved.

I wrote [an accompanying Medium post](https://medium.com/@_erikaybar/optimistic-ui-updates-in-react-9e139ffa2e45) that walks through the first half of the course and the first example of breaking down the process of building a Twitter-inspired user interface where a user can “like” a tweet and explore some of the challenges of optimistically updating the UI to reflect:

1. Whether or not the current user has liked a tweet
2. The current total number of likes a tweet has

Accounting for reverting state upon request failures and a handful of edge cases along the way.
