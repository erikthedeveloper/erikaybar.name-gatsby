So I've been having some fun recording Javascript tutorials/videos over at [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/instructors/erik-aybar) :)

[![Refactoring Javascript with ES6/ES2015 and functional programming](/content/images/2015/08/refactor_gif.gif)](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-refactoring-array-prototype-by-example-filter-some-foreach)

Here is **my first** published video _(free)_: [Refactoring Javascript w/ Array.prototype methods and ES6 by example](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-refactoring-array-prototype-by-example-filter-some-foreach).

[![Javascript Tutorial Using Array prototype methods](/content/images/2015/08/Refactoring__Array_prototype_by_example__filter__some__forEach__-_JavaScript_Video_Tutorial__free__eggheadio.png)](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-refactoring-array-prototype-by-example-filter-some-foreach)

It is still very early, but I have several videos/topics in the works. I look forward to continually learning by teaching (which I'm finding to be the most effective way for me to learn). And of course, I hope I can help others pick up a thing or two along the way :).

**I would love to hear feedback** and am 100% open for **topic requests**! Let me know in the comments below or come find me on Twitter [@erikthedev_](https://twitter.com/erikthedev_).
