I've been using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for my local, private dev log which has been useful for logging accomplishments and victories at work. I've really been impressed with Gatsby and my current site http://erikaybar.name/ (run on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)) has been long overdue for a rework. I've been wanting to dive deeper with Gatsby and get a fresh start on blogging.

To Ghost's credit, it has been by far the best blogging platform for me to date. It's been chugging along for ~5 years without any issues. I've loved the simple writing UI/CMS backend. I'm hoping I can adjust to Gatsby's more low-level "working with raw directories and markdown files" approach. Ghost is markdown based which should make migrating to Gatsby a breeze.

Next step is to deploy with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), yet another technology I've been wanting to explore. Eventually I'll migrate old posts from the old site, take over the domain, and retire it.
