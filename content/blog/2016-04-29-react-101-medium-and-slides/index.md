I put together these [React 101 slides](http://slides.com/erikaybar/react-101) for a presentation I gave at our local Javascript Meetup.

<iframe src="//slides.com/erikaybar/react-101/embed?style=light" width="576" height="420" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

_*I was super impressed with https://slides.com/. This was my first time using it and putting together that presentation was a pleasure!_

...and ended up writing an accompanying Medium post [React 101: Condensed](https://medium.com/@_erikaybar/one-developers-condensed-intro-to-react-68cbf078f992#.8w4w57qt4)

That is all :) If you find any of this interesting or useful, feel free to comment below and/or ping me on Twitter [@erikthedev_](https://twitter.com/erikthedev_)!
