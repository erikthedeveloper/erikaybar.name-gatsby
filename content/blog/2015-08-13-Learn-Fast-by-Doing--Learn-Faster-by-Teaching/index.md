#### The Impact of Teaching and Mentoring

on my own Pursuit of Learning
(and screencasting!)

I previously shared some experiences and thoughts relating to [**Investing in Yourself** as a Software Developer (and why your employer should too)](https://medium.com/@_erikaybar/investing-in-your-career-as-a-software-developer-e750ba20bdd1). I talked a lot about the huge value that self-driven, online resources have provided me over the years. These have played a major role in my journey into entering the technology industry and professional growth.

I left out one huge piece of that story. I may have over-emphasized specifics, money, and employer responsibility. The core of what my experiences have taught me is more related to a general hunger for learning and growth.

More recently I have discovered tremendous value from teaching. Maybe teaching is too formal of a word. More like sharing and discussing knowledge with others. This can take many forms. A few forms of “teaching” that have impacted me:

- Answering questions on StackOverflow
- [Opening myself up as a mentor](https://www.codementor.io/erikthedeveloper) for those looking to learn (both formally and informally)
- Sharing and discussing techniques and challenges in the workplace
- Starting [my own technical blog](http://erikaybar.name)
- Creating miniature screencasts for fun and in the workplace
- Most recently, [becoming an Egghead.io instructor](https://egghead.io/instructors/erik-aybar)

I consistently find that when tasked with helping someone else understand something better, I always come out with a much better grasp of the topic.

[One of my “Refactoring Javascript” lessons](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-refactoring-array-prototype-by-example-filter-some-foreach) boiled down to a 0:02 GIF

How did I end up here? I’m sure the long version of that story will follow in posts to come. For now, I’ll rewind to just several months ago…

### Maybe I Should Start Giving Some Back…

It was only a few months ago that I decided to take my first stab at recording a screencast. My only real goal with doing so was forcing myself out of my comfort zone and _hoping that I could learn some things along the way_. Considering how much I’ve taken away from others’ blog posts, screencasts, and tech talks, I felt like it was time to start putting a little bit back into the coffers. I secretly hoped that it could be of use to others.

**It turns out** [**recording a screencast**](https://egghead.io/articles/recording-a-great-coding-screencast) **is much harder than I had imagined.** First you have to select, and stick to, a cohesive set of topics. Then juggling figuring out how to record, edit, and publish a screencast. It was a bit overwhelming at first.

![My first **published** attempt at a screencast.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*m1hLJusCFusLdW0tebQ8yQ.png)
My first **published** attempt at a screencast.

As with most things I set out to learn, I dove in and figured it out as I went. **I started recording more screencasts.** Some just for practice that never saw the light of day. Some made it onto Vimeo. Then I started publishing a few to YouTube. Needless to say, in retrospect my first several screencasts were low quality, lengthy, and overall just pretty terrible :). No matter the end result of these, I did find I was learning a lot through the process.

One surprisingly useful area I found myself recording screencasts in was the workplace. I work 100% remotely and our development team is primarily remote/distributed. I started recording short walk-throughs and/or tutorials of either new features completed or new technologies/techniques being introduced. How to write tests for new API endpoints with [Behat](http://docs.behat.org/en/v3.0/), Setting up and Using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), TDD w/ [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/)/[PHPSpec](http://www.phpspec.net/en/latest/), etc….

I quickly found that putting ~30 minutes into a _fairly raw_ ~5 to ~10 minute video forced me to learn these topics on a much deeper level. These short videos helped to communicate concepts that were difficult to convey via textual chat or reproduce during a [ScreenHero](https://screenhero.com/) session. They also forced me to start **distilling concepts down to ~5:00 videos, which is a lot more work than it might sound.**

**Fast forward 6 months** or so and [here I am as an instructor on Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/instructors/erik-aybar).

It has been an exciting opportunity and I have already learned a ton throughout the process. There are a lot of [super smart developers involved as instructors](https://egghead.io/instructors) who are **a lot smarter than me.** If I’m being 100% honest, it can be hard not to fall into [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) knowing that I am putting material up side-by-side with some of these guys. Which is **not a bad thing at all.**

If you are the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room.

I’m not sure where or when the first time I heard this quote was, but it has stuck with me since. Here are some thoughts on [“Are You the Smartest Person in the Room?”](https://tommcfarlin.com/smartest-person-in-the-room/). I feel like settling into your comfort zone and no longer feeling the need to improve is what leads to stagnation. This is especially important to succeed in the technology industry.

I have several videos/topics in the works and I look forward to continually learning by teaching (which I’m growing to appreciate more and more). And of course, I hope I can help others pick a thing or two up along the way.
