## To Begin...

I was recently tasked with creating a web development tutorial. The only restriction? To create my own adventure!

My Adventure of Choice: **[SailsJS](http://sailsjs.org/)**

I've been meaning to tackle **node.js** for a bit now and this seemed like as good a time as any.

## Setup and Installation

I decided to setup a local **Vagrant** box to serve as my node.js / SailsJS playground.

In the meantime (while my Vagrant box is installing), I hopped onto my trusty **Digital Ocean** droplet, installed MongoDB and SailsJS. Created a new SailsJS project... and was up in running in literally seconds.

## More to come...

As in... there will be more to come! ;)

** *Edit: In about the time it took me to write this post, I was up and running on my Vagrant box (thank you [Vaprobash](http://fideloper.github.io/Vaprobash/)! ** ... on to building something great! ... or just something ;)
